# November 2025 Updates

Hello everyone! 🖖 It's ALIVE!!

[<img src="https://github.com/daveprowse/Draw-On-Gnome/raw/main/media/gnome-extensions.png" width="250">](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7921/draw-on-gnome/)

This is the first GNOME extension that I have had approved. It's been about a year of work (on and off) and the job is done. I seriously can't believe it. I downloaded and tested it on my laptop (Debian Sid GNOMEv48.5) as well as GNOME 49 VMs and it works.

- Many thanks to JustPerfection on E.G.O. for all of the tips and code suggestions. 
- And many, MANY thanks to everyone here who helped to make this extension accessible worldwide on GNOME Extensions: @esauvisky , @aabrame, @jmaibaum , @litemotiv , @carvalhods , and anyone else that I am forgetting!

Here's the link: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7921/draw-on-gnome/
Available for GNOME v48 and v49.

Again, thanks to everyone involved, I could not have done this without you! 
♥️♥️ 🏆🏆 👍👍

> Note: I also uploaded this as a new release. In keeping with E.G.O. version numbering, this is now known as version 4.0.
