# March 2025 Updates

Hello everyone! 🖖 Here are some updates:

- I re-branded the tool. By popular demand, the new name is **Draw On Gnome**. The old github link (DrawOnYourScreen3) should redirect to the new one: [https://github.com/daveprowse/Draw-On-Gnome](https://github.com/daveprowse/Draw-On-Gnome).
- Restarted version numbering at 1.0 and dropped a new [release](https://github.com/daveprowse/Draw-On-Gnome/releases/tag/D.O.G.-ver-1.0).
- Rebuilt, tested and pushed the installer bash script.
- Fixed and rebuilt translations.
- I tested with GitHub Organizations. I tried two different imports and it failed both times. As such, I am not getting a pleasant feeling about organizations so far, so I am going to step away from that idea for now.
- Currently working on fixing code so E.G.O. can approve the extension. It's been a tough go. Fix one thing and it breaks another. Unfortunately, the code requires a lot of changes to meet GNOME GJS standards. Working on it and testing as I go to make sure everything is functional with each change. I may be posting issues and requesting help with some of the JavaScript work!
