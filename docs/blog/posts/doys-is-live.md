# DOYS3 is LIVE!

Hello fellow screen artists! Welcome to this first blog post.

I've been hard at work with DOYS3. It's been a fun adventure so far! 😎

Here's what I've been up to:

- Configured three versions of DOYS for the various versions of GNOME.
- Wrote a bash script to automatically install the correct version based on the identified GNOME version. See the **[Installation Page](../../installation.md)** for more information. 
- Created this documentation site. Thanks to squidfunk and the amazing Material for Mkdocs. I've been using this software for years and it keeps getting better. Check it out!

- Began the process of getting GNOME to officially accept the extension on extensions.gnome.org.

!!! warning "MAIN branch is frozen"

    I froze the main branch until we either: get approval from E.G.O, or a major update is required for GNOMEv48, whichever comes first. The current working branch is [E.G.O.-v15.1-alpha](https://github.com/daveprowse/DrawOnYourScreen3/tree/E.G.O.-v15.1-alpha){target="_blank"} which will be merged into main once approval is complete.

Looking forward to the alpha version of GNOMEv48 in January. Hoping that we don't have to make too many modifications to the code this time! 🙏

That's it. I'll be posting here with anything new that we are working on. Happy Holidays to you! 🎉
