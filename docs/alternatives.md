# Alternatives

If you use a Linux desktop other than GNOME, for example KDE Plasma or XFCE, then you cannot run GNOME extensions. (At least, out of the box.) The same holds true if you use a tiling window manager (Hyprland, Awesome, etc.).

If, for whatever reason, you cannot run the Draw On Gnome extension, here are some FOSS Linux alternatives:

## gromit-mpx

This is a simpler program but it can run on any *nix-based system.
  
!!! tip "My Goto Backup"
  
    This is my backup drawing program in case Draw On Gnome fails.

## ScreenPen

Another good alternative. This displays a clickable palette.

## Xournal++

[link](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp){target="_blank"}

More of a note taking app.

## OpenBoard

[link](https://github.com/OpenBoard-org/OpenBoard){target="_blank"}

This is a whiteboarding solution.

## Drawing
[link](https://flathub.org/apps/com.github.maoschanz.drawing){target="_blank"}

This is a Flatpak install. Written in Python, can work on any Linux distro or GUI.  

## DrawPen

This is a new development for Linux and other OSes. It has some real promise!
