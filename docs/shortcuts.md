Press `Ctrl + F1` to see the list of current shortcuts while working in **Draw On Gnome**. You can also view them in the extension **Settings > Preferences** but you will have to exit out of Draw On Gnome to do so.

!!! note "Note about `KP`"

    If you press `Ctrl+F1` you will see a lot of shortcuts that have "KP" in them. This is short for "KeyPad". You *do not* have to press `KP` on the keyboard for these. So, for example, to use the color picker, the shortcut shows as `Ctrl+KP 0`, but you only need to press `Ctrl+0` on the keyboard (pressing the `0` either in the main portion of the keyboard or the numeric keypad).

    The beauty of the "KP" portion is that you can use the KeyPad key in question with the keypad number lock on or off. More...(1)

    1. :man_raising_hand: The shortcuts menu (`Ctrl+F1`) shows those shortcuts with "KP" in the name. We won't be changing this anytime soon because they are automatically generated from the XML schema file in a programmatic way. This particular method allows for the user to press the particular key on the numeric keypad with the number lock on or off. 

To modify any keyboard shortcut you will need to exit Draw On Gnome, go to Preferences(1), click the current shortcut key and press the new shortcut key you would like to use.
