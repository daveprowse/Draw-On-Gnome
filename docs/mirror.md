# Mirror Tool (under development)

This tool is still under development. It is an interesting tool that combines mirroring and rotating.

The keyboard shortcuts are:

- `Crtl+C` (alone) - for reflection, or line symmetry.
- `Ctrl+C + Ctrl "hold"` for inversion, or point symmetry.

It takes a little getting used to and like I say, a work in progress. it may not always function as intended!

It works best if the element is the only one on the screen.
