> **IMPORTANT!!**: Currently, this will *only* install to GNOMEv48 and v49. If you need the extension for another version of GNOME, see Option 2.

## Option 2: Use the Automated Script

1. Copy the following command to a *Bash* terminal and press `enter` to run it:

   ```bash
   bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daveprowse/scripts/refs/heads/main/dog-install.sh)
   ```

   The script will attempt to identify your version of GNOME and install the correct version of the extension automatically. 
   
   > Note: Currently, the script will identify GNOME v49 through v40 and back all the way to v3.xx.

   > Note: You may need to enter your sudo password during the install. Make sure you are a sudoer!

   > **IMPORTANT!!** Always check scripts before running them! If you are uncomfortable running the script, or cannot run the script, then install manually with an option listed in the [Documentation](https://daveprowse.github.io/Draw-On-Gnome/installation/).

2. Logout and log back in.

3. Enable the extension:

- In the GUI
  - Open the GNOME Extensions App:

      `gnome-extensions-app`

  - Locate Draw On GNOME and enable it.


- In the CLI:

  ```console
  gnome-extensions enable draw-on-gnome@daveprowse.github.io
  ```


   > Note: You can install the Gnome Extensions App with the package `gnome-shell-extensions-prefs` within your Linux distribution.

4. Now go forth and use the tool by pressing `Super + Alt + D`.

   > Note: You can discover the keyboard shortcuts by pressing `Ctrl + F1`.

It's back to the drawing board my friends! Enjoy! 😎
